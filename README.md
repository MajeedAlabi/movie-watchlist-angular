# MovieWatchlistAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

## Development server
Run `npm install` or `npm i` to intsall all dependencies in the app.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` OR Run `ng serve --port 4200` to automatically run it on your local host 4200.We are running it on port 4200 because the mock data (API) is being called on that particular port. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Features
A simple app used to show understanding of how to obtain data from mock APIs. The app fetches data from the data file in the assets folder and displays the result. There is also a review page in which interested movies can gte reviwed and ratings by the user. 

## Limitations
-The login page can only be accessed with the credientials [{username: "majeed"}, {password: "1234"}]

-The rating features which was supposed to use ng-bootstrap-rating is still giving me difficulties (i will make sure to rectify in due time)

-The Review page is a read only page , the user's review cant be pushed to the page yet.
